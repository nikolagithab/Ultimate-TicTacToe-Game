# ultimate_tic_tac_toe

Description:		
This project includes development and publishing a webpage for members to play an ultimate TICTACTOE game modeled after the regular TICTACTOE game. The game chooses a random start person between player	"X" and	player "O", then challenges the player to align	three of his/her tokens in an internal grid. Ultimately the player should aim to align three oh his/her winning	internal grids.	After each turn the player is told whose turn it is and if there are wrong overriding entries. The game ends once the player alignes three winning	internal grids	correctly, or once they run out of available entries. When the game ends, the players	are given an option to reset the game and playing again.
